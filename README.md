SAVE FILE "pil.py" TO FOLDER WITH IMAGES THAT YOU WANT TO EDIT AND RUN THE CODE

code which: 

applies b/w filter and crops to 1080*1080 size all images in img folder;

adds to all images a watermark (can be image or text) at right bottom corner

(I couldn't create requrements.txt, just download Pillow and Tkinter libaries on python)
